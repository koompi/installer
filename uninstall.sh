Welcome to the PIONUX Uninstaller.

This script will ease the process of restoring your device
to factory settings.

Before getting started, you will need to:

1. Connect your device to your computer over USB

2. Enable USB Debugging on your device:

    1)  Go to the Settings app and scroll down to
        the System section

        NOTE: If you already have "Developer options"
        under System then go directly to #5

    2)  Tap on "About phone"
    3)  Tap "Build number" 7 times until you get a message
        that says you are now a developer
    4)  Go back to the main Settings app
    5)  Tap on "Developer options"
    6)  Ensure that "USB debugging" is enabled
    7)  Tap "OK" if you see a dialog asking you to allow
        USB Debugging for your computer's RSA key fingerprint

WARNING: Uninstalling PIONUX will wipe all your personal data
so make sure you first back-up anything important!

    1. Please download your device's factory image for the Android version you want:

        https://developers.google.com/android/images

    2. Untar the factory image archive (change the name to match the image you downloaded):

        $ tar xzvf hammerhead-lmy48m-factory-bf3c82fd.tgz

    3. Copy-paste the full path to the extracted directory below.
       It should look something like:

        /home/USER/Downloads/hammerhead-lmy48m
