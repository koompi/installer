PLEASE READ BEFORE INSTALLING
=============================

Before deciding to install the PIONUX beta on your device, please be aware of the
following:

**Installing PIONUX will wipe all of your personal data so please back up anything
important!**

You can back up important stuff like photos/videos/text messages/call logs
somewhere off of your device, like your PC or the cloud. There are several apps
available from the Play store that can help you with this--just search "backup".

If you use a custom recovery that supports backups like TWRP, make sure to take
a complete device backup before installing PIONUX using the update zip.

**Ensure you use the correct installer for your device!**

Please double-check that the codename in the installer zip matches your device's
codename. For example, PIONUX-v0.3-installer-hammerhead-windows-6773e9ba.zip is
only for hammerhead (Nexus 5).

**DISCLAIMER**: The PIONUX OS Project authors will not be held responsible for any
loss of data or damage to your device. Keep in mind that installing aftermarket
firmware may void your device's warranty.

IF YOU ALREADY HAVE A CUSTOM RECOVERY
-------------------------------------

Update: PIONUX OS now has a standard update zip that you can flash with TWRP just
like any other ROM--use that instead!

Our installer assumes you have a basic stock setup with stock recovery. It will
format cache and userdata, then flash boot and system. On the Nexus 5, this will
wipe any back-ups you have made with a custom recovery like TWRP since the Nexus
5 emulates /sdcard on userdata, so watch out!

You may be able to get around this by manually flashing boot and system and then
immediately entering your custom recovery and doing a cache wipe and factory
reset from there.


INSTALLING
==========

Installing PIONUX on your device is easy!

Just run the interactive installer script and follow along.

Mac
---

Navigate to the unzipped installer folder, right-click (Control + click) "install",
and select Open.

Tip: Depending on your security settings, you may get a dialog that says
"install is from an unidentified developer. Are you sure you want to open it?".
Please select Open. See https://support.apple.com/kb/PH21769?locale=en_US for
more details. We promise we're not malware :)


Linux
-----

Open a terminal, cd to the unzipped installer, and run the "install.sh" script with:

    $ ./install.sh


Windows
-------

First, install the Google USB Driver to communicate with Nexus devices:

1.  Enable USB Debugging on your device (see HOW TO ENABLE USB DEBUGGING below)

2.  Download the driver from http://developer.android.com/sdk/win-usb.html

3.  Install the driver following the instructions on
    http://developer.android.com/tools/extras/oem-usb.html#InstallingDriver

    NOTE: Step 3 for Windows 7 says "Select 'Devices' in the left pane". If you
    don't see 'Devices', look instead for 'Device Manager'.

Then navigate to the unzipped installer folder and double-click "install".

Tip: We have found that installing the Google USB Driver can be very confusing.
You may need to select the driver for your device multiple times before
Windows finally installs it correctly. You may also need to wait while Windows
installs the driver a second time after your device boots into recovery mode.


UNINSTALLING / RESTORING TO FACTORY
===================================

If you've installed PIONUX and decided you want to get your device back to
the way it was, you can easily re-install your factory image with our
interactive uninstaller.

Grab your device's factory image for the Android version you would like from
https://developers.google.com/android/images and follow along.

NOTE: You will have to enable USB Debugging again even if you already did so for
installing PIONUX. (You must be a pro at this by now!)

Mac
---

Navigate to the unzipped installer folder, right-click (Control + click) "uninstall",
and select Open.

Tip: Depending on your security settings, you may get a dialog that says
"uninstall is from an unidentified developer. Are you sure you want to open it?".
Please select Open. See https://support.apple.com/kb/PH21769?locale=en_US for
more details. We promise we're not malware :)


Linux
-----

Open a terminal, cd to the unzipped installer, and run the "uninstall.sh" script with:

    $ ./uninstall.sh


Windows
-------

Navigate to the unzipped installer folder and double-click "uninstall".


You should now have a fresh factory installation on your device.


RESTORING GOOGLE APPS
=====================

If you would like to restore access to the Play store for your device, you will
need to do a little extra work.

We have had success using the TWRP custom recovery to restore Google apps:

1.  Download Play apps from a 3rd party packager like Open Gapps and save it in
    the same directory you unzipped the PIONUX installer:

    http://opengapps.org/?arch=arm&api=6.0&variant=pico

2.  Download the latest TWRP for your device and save it in the same directory
    you unzipped the PIONUX installer:

    https://twrp.me/Devices/

3.  Connect your device to your computer, enable USB Debugging,
    and follow the instructions below depending on your platform:

    (Make sure to substitute the correct name of the file you downloaded for anything in brackets)

    Mac or Linux
    ------------

    Open up a terminal and run the following:

    $ cd <unzipped pionux installer directory>
    $ ./adb push -p <gapps filename>.zip /sdcard/
    $ ./adb reboot bootloader
    $ ./fastboot flash recovery <twrp filename>.img

    Windows
    -------

    Open up Command Prompt and run the following:

    $ cd <unzipped pionux installer directory>
    $ adb push -p <gapps filename>.zip /sdcard/
    $ adb reboot bootloader
    $ fastboot flash recovery <twrp filename>.img


You will now be in the bootloader and need to do a few more steps:

4.  Use the <Volume Up> button on your device to cycle through the bootloader options
    to "Recovery mode" and hit the <Power> button to boot into TWRP recovery

    (You will be greeted by a screen that allows you to "Keep Read Only" or "Swipe to Allow
    Modifications". It's safest to tap "Keep Read Only": TWRP will be replaced by your stock
    recovery after your phone reboots. Alternatively, if you would like to keep TWRP recovery
    on your device after your phone reboots, swipe right.)

5.  Tap "Install"

6.  Tap the Google apps zip file that you downloaded earlier (you may need to scroll down)

7.  Swipe to confirm flash of the Google apps

8.  Tap "Reboot System" to reboot back into PIONUX

    (You may be asked to install SuperSU to root your device. If you know what rooting your
    device means and want to have it rooted then go ahead. Otherwise, it's best to tap
    "Do Not Install".)

You should now have Google Play apps!


HOW TO ENABLE USB DEBUGGING
===========================

You'll see instructions to enable USB Debugging as the first step before
running our installer or uninstaller. Enabling USB Debugging is important
because it lets the PIONUX installer talk to your device.

1.  Go to the Settings app and scroll down to the System section

    NOTE: If you already have "Developer options"
    under System then go directly to #5

2.  Tap on "About phone"
3.  Tap "Build number" 7 times until you get a message
    that says you are now a developer
4.  Go back to the Settings app and scroll down to the System section again
5.  Tap on "Developer options"
6.  Ensure that "USB debugging" is enabled
7.  Tap "OK" if you see a dialog asking you to allow USB Debugging for
    your computer's RSA key fingerprint (you may have to do this multiple
    times unless you check "Always allow from this computer")

Remember that you will have to enable USB Debugging again whenever your
device factory resets (after unlocking your bootloader for example) or
completes a fresh install.
